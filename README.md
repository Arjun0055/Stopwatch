# Stopwatch
This was one of the first javascript projects that I created. The project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is a stopwatch which include microseconds, seconds and minutes. 

There are three buttons. 

They are: 

Start - This button starts the timer. 
Stop - This button stops the timer but doesn't reset it. 
Reset - This button resets the timer i.e everything goes back to zero.

Updates :

1) Now, hours have also been added.
2) Added a sound effect in the javascript file.
3) Everytime the stopwatch hits an hour it makes a sound effect.
