# Stopwatch
This was one of the first javascript projects that I created. The project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is a stopwatch which include microseconds, seconds and minutes. 

There are three buttons. 

They are: 

Start - This button starts the timer. 
Stop - This button stops the timer but doesn't reset it. 
Reset - This button resets the timer i.e everything goes back to zero.
